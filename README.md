# 🌱 Fundamentals of Intelligent Systems – 4041

Welcome to the official repository for the **Fundamentals of Intelligent Systems** course 🌿  
This space contains the **mini-project** and **final project** implementations designed to explore modern concepts in **machine learning** and **intelligent systems**.

---

### ✨ Overview
The code in this repository demonstrates core ideas that form the backbone of intelligent systems — combining theoretical understanding with practical experiments.

You will find implementations inspired by the concepts of:
- Dimensionality reduction and feature optimization  
- Supervised learning algorithms including **SVM (RBF kernel)**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests**  
- Optimization techniques for improving model performance  
- Reinforcement learning using **Q‑Learning**  
- Unsupervised learning through clustering and pattern discovery  

---

### ⚙️ Technologies
Developed primarily in **Python**, leveraging powerful libraries for data manipulation and machine learning such as:
- `NumPy`, `Pandas`
- `Scikit‑learn`
- `Matplotlib`

---

### 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as a hands‑on journey through the essential mechanisms that make systems *intelligent* — from decision‑making under uncertainty to learning from data and experience.

Every implementation aims to blend clarity, simplicity, and strong practical connection to theoretical foundations.
